# Codes and data of HRI's mini-project

## Ademo: Emotion Recognition for video advertisements

## About Deap Data:
Deap data should be saved in ./deap_data folder if needed

## The structure of codes(Model.ipynb):
-> Prepare the model
	-> Import dependencies
	-> Data loading functions
	-> Data preprocessing funcitons
	-> Method 1 to split train data and eval data
	-> Method 2 to split train data and eval data
	-> Evaluation functions
	-> Model Definition
-> Run the model

## How to run: 
1. Open Model.ipynb
2. Run every part in "Prepare the model" section orderly
3. Change the parameters according to the demand of the problems
4. Run "Run the model" section to trian and evaluate the model on the dataset. You can use 2 different methods(at last sentence)
5. Results are shown as below
